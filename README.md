TripRescue is an explainable travel disruption recovery engine that models multi-leg itineraries as dependency graphs. When one booking is disrupted, TripRescue propagates the impact across connected bookings, explains exactly what breaks and why, generates feasible recovery plans, ranks them according to traveler priorities, and re-validates the itinerary after recovery.

## 1. Overview
TripRescue is an intelligent, explainable travel disruption recovery platform. Rather than viewing an itinerary as an isolated checklist of tickets, TripRescue models the entire trip as a directed dependency graph. When a disruption occurs (such as a flight delay or cancellation), the system traces the cascade of downstream impacts, evaluates timing constraints and minimum connection buffers, classifies node health, generates multi-booking recovery candidates, ranks options based on traveler preferences, and re-validates the graph upon resolution.

## 2. Problem Statement
Travel disruptions are rarely isolated. A 90-minute delay on an inbound flight frequently causes:
$$\text{Flight Delay} \longrightarrow \text{Missed Airport Transfer} \longrightarrow \text{Hotel Check-in Conflict} \longrightarrow \text{Missed Excursion} \longrightarrow \text{Return Flight Risk}$$

Existing travel applications notify travelers of delay alerts in silos. The traveler is left to manually calculate connection buffers, determine which downstream reservations are in jeopardy, check conflicting cancellation policies, search alternative flights/hotels/transfers, and piece together a coherent recovery plan under immense stress.

## 3. Solution
TripRescue automates this entire cognitive loop:
```
Disruption Trigger → Dependency Graph → Impact Propagation → Severity Classification
   → Recovery Candidate Generation → Preference-Based Ranking → Plan Selection → Graph Re-validation
```
Every action is deterministic, transparent, and explainable, providing travelers with clear diagnostic reasoning ("required buffer is 60 min, remaining buffer is -30 min") alongside actionable recovery packages.

## 4. Core Innovation
1. **Explainable Cascade Reasoning**: Clear mathematical diagnostic reasons for every affected booking rather than arbitrary warning flags.
2. **Granular Severity Classification**: Precise status per node (`healthy`, `at_risk`, `broken`, `recovered`) derived from real buffer calculations.
3. **Multi-Booking Coordinated Recovery**: Recovery plans address the entire downstream chain in a unified package (e.g., flight + hotel + transfer).
4. **Real-Time Preference-Weighted Ranking**: Multi-dimensional scoring (speed, cost, disruption, comfort, risk) adjusted dynamically via traveler preference sliders.
5. **Transparent Scoring Breakdown**: Full visibility into candidate scoring components.
6. **Full Graph Re-Validation**: Post-recovery graph re-propagation proves that the selected plan produces a conflict-free itinerary.
7. **Sequential Re-Disruption Support**: Trips maintain canonical state; recovered itineraries can experience further independent disruptions.
8. **AI Assistant with Deterministic Fallback**: Grounded in live graph state with an integrated fallback when LLM keys are absent.

## 5. How TripRescue Works
1. **Model**: The itinerary is ingested and structured into nodes (flights, transfers, stays, activities) connected by temporal and location dependency edges.
2. **Detect & Propagate**: A disruption event triggers downstream topological traversal, recomputing arrival times and connection buffers.
3. **Diagnose**: Nodes are tagged with precise severity and human-readable explanations.
4. **Generate & Rank**: Candidate recovery options are assembled from provider adapters, filtered for temporal feasibility, and ranked.
5. **Execute & Re-validate**: Applying a recovery modifies the graph state and immediately re-evaluates all constraints to verify trip health.

## 6. Dependency Graph Engine
The backend graph engine builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing bookings as nodes and dependencies as edges:
- **Temporal Edges**: Ensures end time of node $A$ precedes start time of node $B$ with required buffer $\Delta t$.
- **Location Edges**: Ensures arrival location of node $A$ matches departure location of node $B$.
- **Buffer Rules**: Strict buffer thresholds based on connection type (e.g., 60 min for domestic flights, 120 min for international, 45 min for ground transfers).

## 7. Disruption Propagation
When a disruption occurs on node $N_i$:
- The engine updates arrival time $T_{arr}(N_i) = T_{arr}^{orig}(N_i) + \text{delay}$.
- It traverses outgoing edges in topological order.
- For each downstream node $N_j$, available buffer is calculated: $\text{Buffer}_{avail} = T_{dep}(N_j) - T_{arr}(N_i)$.
- If $\text{Buffer}_{avail} < 0$, node $N_j$ is classified as `broken`.
- If $0 \le \text{Buffer}_{avail} < \text{Buffer}_{req}$, node $N_j$ is classified as `at_risk`.

## 8. Impact Analysis
The impact analysis module summarizes:
- Total downstream bookings affected.
- Direct root cause and cascading failure chain.
- Financial value of broken vs. at-risk bookings.
- Time lost or schedule shifts.

## 9. Recovery Generation
The recovery engine queries provider adapters to find viable alternatives:
- **Direct Rebooking**: Finding earlier/later flights or alternative carriers.
- **Rescheduling**: Adjusting transfer and activity times to accommodate delays.
- **Node Replacement**: Substituting unviable activities or hotels with available alternatives.
- **Chain Bundling**: Generating composite recovery packages that resolve all broken nodes simultaneously.

## 10. Recovery Ranking
Recovery options are scored using a normalized multi-objective function:
$$\text{Score} = w_{\text{cost}} \cdot S_{\text{cost}} + w_{\text{speed}} \cdot S_{\text{speed}} + w_{\text{preservation}} \cdot S_{\text{preservation}} + w_{\text{comfort}} \cdot S_{\text{comfort}} + w_{\text{risk}} \cdot S_{\text{risk}}$$
Every candidate presents its full breakdown so the traveler understands the trade-offs.

## 11. Traveler Preferences
Travelers can interactively adjust priority sliders:
- **Cost vs. Speed**: Prioritize cheapest solutions vs. earliest arrival.
- **Disruption vs. Comfort**: Prioritize preserving original bookings vs. upgrading convenience.
Weights are re-applied instantly to re-rank all available recovery plans.

## 12. Recovery Application
Applying a selected recovery plan:
- Atomically updates canonical booking records.
- Replaces broken nodes with recovered nodes.
- Updates edge constraints and schedules.
- Records activity history and dispatches notifications.

## 13. Re-validation
Following recovery application, the graph engine re-runs full impact propagation from scratch:
- Validates that zero `broken` nodes remain.
- Recalculates all connection buffers.
- Updates trip health status to `recovered` / `healthy`.

## 14. Risk Intelligence
TripRescue features a proactive risk engine that monitors:
- Weather vulnerability at transit hubs.
- Historical buffer tight-spots.
- Tight connections with high cascade potential.
- Provides actionable mitigation advice before disruptions occur.

## 15. Financial / Refund Analysis
The refund engine evaluates:
- Cancellation policies (non-refundable, partially refundable, flexible).
- Potential out-of-pocket recovery costs.
- Net refund eligibility across affected bookings.
- Total recovered value vs. disruption loss.

## 16. AI Assistant
An integrated AI Copilot provides contextual explanations and recommendations:
- Grounded directly in live trip, disruption, and recovery state.
- Capable of answering questions like "Why did my transfer break?" and "What is the fastest recovery?".
- Includes a robust deterministic rule-based fallback when external LLM API keys are not configured.

## 17. Activity Log
Maintains an immutable timeline of all itinerary events:
- Disruption triggers and delay detections.
- Impact calculations.
- Recovery option evaluations and user selections.
- Re-validation confirmations.

## 18. Notifications
Centralized in-app notification center that alerts travelers to:
- Disruption severity alerts.
- Recommended recovery plans.
- Successful re-validation confirmations.
- Schedule adjustments.

## 19. Demo Mode
TripRescue includes interactive hero scenarios (e.g., London to Tokyo multi-leg journey):
- One-click disruption simulation (e.g., 90-minute flight delay).
- Guided walkthrough demonstrating cascade propagation, impact analysis, recovery ranking, and re-validation.
- Deterministic simulation mode for rapid testing.

## 20. Authentication
- Lightweight session token authentication with HMAC signing.
- One-click demo traveler login ("Continue as Aisha Khan") for instant access.
- Role-based isolation for traveler itineraries.

- **Backend API**: [https://triprescue-kw9d.onrender.com](https://triprescue-kw9d.onrender.com)
- **API Health Endpoint**: [https://triprescue-kw9d.onrender.com/api/health](https://triprescue-kw9d.onrender.com/api/health)

## 27. Deployment
- **Frontend**: Hosted on GitHub Pages as a static SPA bundle.
- **Backend**: Hosted on Render with FastAPI and SQLite.
- **Environment**: Configured via `.env.example` templates with automatic mock fallback.

## 28. Current Limitations
- **Disruption Ingestion**: Disruption events are currently triggered manually or simulated via Demo Mode (deterministic scenarios). Direct live flight radar / GDS webhook feeds are planned for future phases.
- **Provider Layer**: Provider queries use realistic mock adapters with simulated availability rather than live commercial airline/hotel booking APIs.
- **Payments**: Financial engine calculates refund eligibility and cost deltas; live credit card payment processing is out of scope.
- **Free-Tier Backend Hosting**: Render's free tier spins down on idle; initial cold-start requests may take up to 60 seconds.

## 29. Future Roadmap
- Direct GDS / NDC airline API integrations (Amadeus, Sabre).
- Real-time flight tracking telemetry and weather radar webhooks.
- Multi-passenger group recovery coordination with diverging preference profiles.
- Native mobile companion application (iOS / Android).
- Automated automated claim filing for delay compensation (EU261 / DOT).

## 31. How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.11+

### 1. Start Backend
```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
Backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (Swagger docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`).

### 2. Start Frontend
```powershell
# In a separate terminal
cd frontend
npm install
copy .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```
Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. Click **"Continue as Demo Traveler"** to access the dashboard with the seeded backend trips.

### 3. Safar Sathi frontend notes
- **Landing page** (src/landing): shown to signed-out visitors. The hero is a lazy-loaded React Three Fiber scene (procedural low-poly models, no model downloads) that plays the Mumbai → Delhi → Agra disruption-and-recovery story; it pauses off-screen, shows a still frame under prefers-reduced-motion, and falls back to static art without WebGL (force with ?hero=static). **Get Started** opens sign-in; **Watch Demo** opens the offline demo and plays the guided recovery flow.
- **Screens** (hash routes, so deep links work on static hosting): `#/dashboard`, `#/bookings`, `#/live`, `#/recovery`, `#/assistant`, `#/trip`, `#/claims`, `#/settings`.
- **Offline demo**: "Explore offline demo" on the sign-in screen runs the full UI against an in-browser data source (`src/services/demoBackend.ts`) that mirrors the API contract, with a Mumbai → Delhi → Agra trip already mid-disruption. Live sessions always use the real backend.
- **Destination imagery**: `src/lib/destinationImages.ts` is the single registry; `<DestinationImage destination="Agra" />` resolves city → alias/airport code → country → generic fallback. Photos are bundled in `public/images` (from Unsplash, used under the Unsplash License).
- **Environment**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (backend origin) and, for sub-path hosting such as GitHub Pages, `VITE_BASE_PATH` (e.g. `/SafarSathi/`) at build time. Add the deployed frontend origin to the backend's `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- **Map tiles**: the world map uses Leaflet with Esri World Imagery tiles (attribution shown on the map).
