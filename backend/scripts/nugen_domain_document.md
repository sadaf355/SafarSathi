## Weather stress rules used by the Digital Twin

DigitalTwinEngine: a sandboxed, weather-driven copy of a trip.

The twin clones the itinerary graph (EngineNodes/EngineEdges are dataclasses;
every mutation happens on `dataclasses.replace` copies), applies a weather
scenario as simultaneous direct hits on the bookings it would plausibly
affect, and runs the same PropagationEngine the live system uses to find the
counterfactual cascade. Nothing here touches the database - the live itinerary
only changes when a traveler applies a plan via the digital twin service.

Stress rules (per booking type, only for bookings overlapping the storm window):
- Flights: visibility < 800 m -> ground stop (120-180 min); wind > 60 km/h ->
  crosswind holds; heavy rain -> flow control; extreme fog/wind -> cancellation.
- Road transfers: rainfall above 35 mm/h (25 on mountain roads) causes
  waterlogging diversions; above 60 (45 mountain) blocks the road outright.
- Trains: dense fog and extreme rain slow services.
- Outdoor activities: wind > 60 km/h or rain > 25 mm/h cancels them; extreme
  heat pushes them to cooler hours.
- Hotels: only extreme flooding threatens check-in; otherwise they are hit
  indirectly through late arrivals (the cascade).

## Dependency semantics

Hard dependencies (flight connections, timed trains) break when the available buffer falls below the required buffer. Soft dependencies (transfer -> hotel -> activity) shift flexible bookings later or flag fixed ones at risk. Bookings more than 24h after an unresolved break are treated as recoverable.

## Worked examples

### Severe Monsoon Deluge (trip-ladakh-2025)

“Severe Monsoon Deluge” brings low visibility during 12 Sep 06:30 - 12 Sep 10:30: Mumbai → Delhi is hit directly — Visibility 300 m is below CAT-I minima; ground stop.
