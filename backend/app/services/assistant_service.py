"""AssistantService: explains engine output - it never computes trip facts itself.

Every number quoted to the traveler (cost, time, risk, buffer) comes from the
propagation/recovery/risk engines via the current database state. When an
Anthropic API key is configured, a real LLM call turns that grounded context into
a natural-language answer. When it isn't (or the call fails for any reason), a
deterministic, keyword-based responder answers from the same grounded context, so
the assistant is never left non-functional.
