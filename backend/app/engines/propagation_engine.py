"""PropagationEngine: computes what actually breaks when a disruption occurs.

This is deliberately NOT "mark everything downstream red". Every node's resulting
status is derived from an explicit buffer/feasibility calculation against its
specific incoming edges, so the algorithm generalizes to any itinerary graph
(branches, multiple dependencies, etc.), not just the Ladakh trip it was designed
against.

Algorithm (see README.md for the full write-up):

1. Build a GraphEngine from the node/edge set and compute a topological order.
   (A cyclic dependency graph is a data error, not a disruption scenario, and is
   rejected up front.)
2. Walk nodes in topological order. For the disrupted node itself, apply the
   disruption's direct effect (delay, cancellation, ...). For every other node,
   evaluate each of its incoming edges against the (already-resolved) upstream
   node and take the worst resulting outcome.
3. Edge evaluation implements two kinds of dependency:
     - HARD edges (e.g. a flight connection): if the upstream is broken/cancelled,
       or if the available buffer is smaller than the edge's required buffer, the
       downstream node becomes BROKEN. There is no "soft landing" for a hard
       dependency - either the connection is feasible or it is not.
     - SOFT edges (e.g. transfer -> hotel -> activity sequencing): a buffer
       shortfall pushes a flexible node's schedule later (DELAYED) or flags an
       inflexible node as AT_RISK, but never breaks it outright - soft
       dependencies are things a traveler can usually still work around.
4. Uncertainty window: when an upstream node is BROKEN/CANCELLED and the
   dependency is SOFT, the downstream node is only marked AT_RISK if it is
   scheduled to start within UNCERTAINTY_WINDOW_HOURS of the disruption. Nodes
   far enough in the future (e.g. an activity two days later) are assumed
   recoverable by then and are left HEALTHY. This single, documented heuristic
   is what produces a realistic "how far does this cascade actually reach"
   boundary without hardcoding which specific nodes are affected.

All timestamps are itinerary-relative (the trip's own calendar), never wall-clock
time, so propagation is fully deterministic and reproducible in tests.
